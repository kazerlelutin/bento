@crafter-navigator
Feature: Navigation between crafter steps

  Scenario: Display step buttons on startup
    Given the DOM contains an element with id "crafter-controls"
    When I initialize the Crafter Navigator
    Then each crafter step has a button in the container
    And the button corresponding to the current step has the aria-current attribute set to "true"
    And the container has click and keydown event listeners attached

  Scenario: Change step by user click
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized with multiple steps
    And the container contains the step buttons
    When I click on the button of a different step
    Then the store's setCurrentStep method is called with the name of the clicked step

  Scenario: Change step by keyboard navigation
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized with multiple steps
    And the container contains the step buttons
    When I press Enter or Space on the button of a different step
    Then the store's setCurrentStep method is called with the name of the focused step

  Scenario: Keyboard navigation accessibility
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized
    Then each button is focusable with Tab key
    And each button can be activated with Enter or Space key
    And each button has proper ARIA attributes for screen readers

  Scenario: UI updates when step changes via the store
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized
    And the current step is "home"
    When the store notifies a step change to "export"
    Then the "export" button has the aria-current attribute set to "true"
    And the "home" button has the aria-current attribute set to "false"

  Scenario: Cleanup subscriptions on destruction
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized
    When I call the cleanup method
    Then the store subscription is removed

  Scenario: Accessibility of step buttons
    Given the Crafter Navigator is initialized
    Then each step button has the role "button"
    And each button has an aria-label attribute containing the step name
    And each button has a tabIndex attribute set to "0"
    And each button has the aria-current attribute set to "false" by default
    And each button has the aria-disabled attribute set to "false"
    And each button has the aria-pressed attribute set to "false"
    And each button has the aria-roledescription attribute set to "Ã©tape du crafter"
